# Terminal Trivia


This command line interface let's you be a contestant on Terminal Trivia. Put your general knowledge skills to the test.

**Terminal Trivia Rules**
1. You **DO NOT** need to include the phrase 'who is', 'what is', or 'when is' (etc.) in your answer
2. There is no deduction of points for an incorrect answer
3. Case (upper or lower) is not relevant
4. You are your own best competition
5. Have fun!  


## Usage

To Install
```$ npm i -g terminal-trivia```

To Play
1. Open your terminal of choice
2. **IMPORTANT** Click to make your terminal full screen
3. Type: ```$ trivia```
4. Have fun!  

## Future

I have grand visions for this project (i.e. adding double jeopardy logic, adding a double jeopardy round, adding a final jeopardy round, making a persistent high score list, etc.). This is an open source project, with an MIT license.
